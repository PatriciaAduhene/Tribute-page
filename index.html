<h2>Here are the time line of Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
<ul>
    <li>His presence- April 15,1952 to May 2,1519</li>
    <li>He was born in Tuscan hamlet near Vinci in Italy</li>
    <li>Da Vinci started nine years of apprenticeship at the age of 14 to Andrea del Verrocchio,a famous sculptor,painter and goldsmith </li>
    <li>In 1473,he was more than halfway his studies with Verrocchio  </li>
    <li>Da Vinci completed Landscape drawing for Santa Maria della Neve,with a pen and ink depiction</li>
    <li>His sketched prolifically, planning inventions, exploring human anatomy, 
        drawing landscapes, and blocking out plans for paintings such as 
        The Virgin of the Rocks and his sole surviving mural, The Last Supper.</li>
    <li>In his mid-years thus 1477-1499,He produced several notable paintings</li>
    <li>Early in his tenure at court, da Vinci produced his first version of Virgin of the Rocks,
         a six-foot-tall altarpiece also called the "Madonna of the Rocks."</li>
    <li>He blended the edges of objects in indistinct light to create a sort of smoky effect 
        known as sfumato in 1483</li>
    <li>The Last Supper- Leonardo da Vinci used oil-based paint on plaster
         for this scene of Jesus and his apostles 
         at the table because his customary
         water-based fresco paints were difficult 
         to blend for the sfumato effect he sought.
         Within only a few decades, much of the painting had
         flaked away from the wall in its location at the Santa Maria del Grazie convent.</li>
    <li> Later years,1500-1519 Leonardo da Vinci completed a greater number of paintings than he had thus far. </li>
    <li> In 1500, the artist made preliminary progress on his painting, Virgin and Child with Saint Anne</li>
    <li>Leonardo began creating his most well-known 
        and replicated work, Mona Lisa, a couple of years later when he received a commission 
        from Francesco del Giocondo to paint his wife.</li>
    <li>sketches.

       
    <li> In approximately the same period, the artist created his second version of the painting, 
        "Virgin of the Rocks," which was likely 
        a commission for installation in a chapel at Milan's church of San Francesco Maggiore.</li>
    <li>Influence of Leonardo da Vinci-His innovative breaks 
        from the artistic standards of his day would guide generations of artists that followed.</li>
